# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects

This Repository contains all the Data Science and Machine Learning Project including the jupyter notebooks/scripts and any related document related to the project.

## EDA PROJECTS

**1.  EDA on movies dataset**

The project analyze the movies dataset released between 2006 and 2016 and analyze the impact of the number of movies releasing over the years and how increasing number of movies releasing every year has impacted the total and average revenue and quality of movies in terms of critics and viewwers ratings.

**2.  EDA on Titanic dataset**

The project analyze the Titanic dataset and does the basic analyzes on the data involves handling missing values,dropping irrelevant features and plotting the graphs to study the required features.

## MACHINE LEARNING PROJECTS

**1. Predicting the housing prices using linear regression**

Applied regression techniques on housing price dataset to predict the price of house based on given parameters.
Data has been pre-processed before applying the multiple regression models and model with low bias,variance and RMSE is finalized
